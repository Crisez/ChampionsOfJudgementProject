# Champions Of Judgement Project
College Capstone Project

This project emphasized on incorporating what I had learned throughout my college education. It was a solo project to create a video game level prototype based around a subject of our choosing that we would research. I chose to look into Unit Flocking in order to create a more dynamic squad system for a Real Time Strategy game. After learning about the formula used to create the flocking effect, I set about to recreate it for the 3D squads in my project. The project also utilized a few database elements and a supporting webpage.
