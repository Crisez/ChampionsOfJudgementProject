								<h1>The Realm</h1>
									<p>The gods holding this contest created two planes of existence within their realm, 
									the mortal plane and the plane that holds the Arenas of Consequence.</p>
								<h2 id="mortal">The Mortal Plane</h2>
									<p>The mortal plane consists of a universe full of planets, several of which hold diverse life
									created by the two gods. The contest is currently being held to decide the fate of the planet Kelvassisk,
									a lush continental world primarily dominated by humans. Kelvassisk is in its Medieval age with keeps and settlements 
									dotting the small world. Several prominent kindoms with powerful lords and ladies control the world, vying for resources and establishing alliances.</p>
								<h2 id="arena">The Arenas of Consequence</h2>
									<p>Long ago the gods bickered on nearly everything. They had recently created the mortal plane and had populated 
									the worlds and designed the very reality that the mortals could concieve, yet when they were done, they could not agree on what to do with it. 
									Eventually, insults turned to violence as the two gods fought within the very fabric of existence. So powerful were the battles between them that it
									shook the mortal realm, devastating several worlds and destroying several species. Eventually, both of the gods noticed the destruction they had wrought to their
									creation and decided to create a compromise to prevent another fight. They created another plane of existence, this one populated with various halls, chambers, and arenas.
									Their powers would be limited when they entered this plane, as to prevent them from cheating in what would be a series of contests to decide the outcome to the various 
									arguments between the two gods.</p>

								<h1>The Contest</h1>
									<p>Every time the two gods have an argument, they settle it with a series of battles held in the Arenas of Consequence. These battles are conducted by stone champions that
									exist solely to fight in this contest. The rules are simple, have your army destroy the enemy base to achieve a victory. The amount of rounds that need to be won is agreed 
									upon prior to the contests, and the gods choose the arenas by taking turns, starting with who picked last in the previous contest.</p>
								<h2 id="reason">The Reason</h2>
									<p>The latest contest was issued by the god of darkness when the god of light proposed that they help influence the advance of humanity through the medieval ages and to the next age. 
									The god of light knew that both gods often helped a species evolve to the next stage of their development if they had stagnated for 1000 years or so, and upon approaching that number 
									for the people of Kelvassisk, the god of light believed that they should provide this aid once more. The god of darkness disagreed, noting that humanity on Kelvassisk had grown petty, 
									and the rulers of the kingdoms were corrupt and power hungry. He believed that they should sabotage the efforts of humanity, to ensure that it had enough time to fix its issues rather 
									than grant those in charge more power by advancing the civilizations. When the god of light said that this was unfair to the denizens of the world and insisted that they should stick to their 
									plan, the god of darkness challenged the god of light to another contest of fate.</p>
								<h2 id="champion">The Champions</h2>
									<p>The champions that participate within the contest are animated stone guardians that take the form of medieval knights. These stone statues swing various weapons made of rock to attempt to shatter 
									each other and claim victory for their god. Though animated, they have no higher cognitive abilities and follow the orders of the gods blindly. All they understand is who their foe is and how to fight them. 
									These champions can appear in various stone forms based on the gods' likings, but will always have a mirror fighting style to their opponent champions. Additionally, the god of light's champions are made from marble
									while the god of darkness's champions are made from purple porphyry stone.</p>
