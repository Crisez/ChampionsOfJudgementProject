								<h1>The God of Light</h1>
									<p>The god of light is optimistic, but stubborn. He acts joyously and regularly rewards mortals who share his attitude or ideals. 
									When creating the universe, he filled it with wonderous sights and lush resources. Wherever the light touches, there is paradise, 
									yet despite his hospitality and kind demeanor, the god of light often overlooks the viewpoints of others besides the god of darkness. 
									To him, he has lived forever, seen and done everything, what is the wisdom of one so short lived compared to his infinite knowledge. 
									The god of light, like the god of darkness, takes many names based on how his followers address him, but his real name is Benthriis.</p>

								<h1>The God of Darkness</h1>
									<p>The god of darkness is pessimistic and pragmatic, but caring nonetheless. During the creation of the universe, he created various perils and 
									threats such as black holes and natural disasters. He saw these aspects of the universe as a balancing act to the many great amenities provided by the god of light. 
									The god of darkness sees hardship as a way to bring people together and a way of testing the resolve of people, but often forgets the concept of relaxing. To him there 
									is little time to spend upon anything other than surviving. He is often referred to as many names or even abstract concepts, but like the god of light, he has a specific name, that being Yulthfrei.</p>
